# About

OB-Xd and its OB-Xx fork are based on the [Oberheim OB-X](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberheim_OB-X). It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design. OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound.

While not copying originals, some of the features were taken to a better point. Continuous blendable multimode filter (HP-Notch(BP)-HP in 12 dB mode and 4-1 pole in 24 dB mode). Also, like many synths of the OB-X's generation, the OB-Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.

Thanks to [2Dat](https://github.com/2DaT/Obxd) for the original OB-Xd and Soshi Studio for giving the rights to continue this wonderful product. Also thanks to [KVR artists for creating some amazing skins!](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=471926)

As a side note, discoDSP claims copyright on the OB-Xd themes, so they can't be used in a free/libre/open source version of this program.
